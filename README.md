Fire Tetris dmxfire16 code
---------

The dmxfire16 is an Arduino-compatible 16 channel solid state relay board with built-in RS-485 serial.  For more information, see [the designer's site](http://propaneandelectrons.com/projects/dmxfire16).

This repo tracks the dmxfire16 as used by [Fire Tetris](http://firetetris.com).

Notes:
* [ ] @scjody will get a version of the firmware that automatically shuts off solenoids after a delay (this already exists but isn't on GitHub).
* [ ] The current rev. of the board has a thermal problem in the PWM chip.  The board's creator is working on a fix.  What we have now will be good enough for testing.
